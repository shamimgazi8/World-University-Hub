Onam is Kerala’s most popular festival, and it is celebrated with great grandeur. It is considered to be Kerala’s national celebration. There is a long mythical story behind why Onam is celebrated. It comes in August-September, which is the first month of the year in the Malayalam calendar and is known as Chingam.

    "description": "<p>With a history spanning over two and a half millennia, Rome is not merely a city; it is a journey through time, a palimpsest of civilizations that have flourished and faded within its embrace. Its very name conjures images of grandeur, from the monumental Colosseum to the exquisite Vatican City. As the heart of the once-mighty Roman Empire, Rome has left an indelible mark on the course of Western civilization.</p><h3>The architecture of Rome speaks in stone of its storied past. </h3><p>The Colosseum, an enduring symbol of ancient engineering prowess, stands as a poignant reminder of the gladiatorial contests that once echoed within its walls. The Pantheon, with its majestic dome, pays homage to Roman gods and showcases the precision of Roman architectural techniques. As one walks through the Roman Forum, the remnants of temples, basilicas, and marketplaces conjure visions of bustling life in antiquity.</p><p>The Vatican, an independent city-state within Rome, is a spiritual and cultural nucleus. Its centerpiece, St. Peter's Basilica, is a pinnacle of Renaissance architecture. Michelangelo's iconic dome crowns the basilica, its silhouette etched against the Roman sky. The Sistine Chapel, adorned with Michelangelo's masterful frescoes, draws pilgrims and art enthusiasts alike, offering an experience that transcends the temporal.</p><p>But Rome's allure extends beyond its physical landmarks; it resides in the very air one breathes. Piazzas like the Spanish Steps and Piazza Navona pulse with life, each cobblestone echoing the laughter and conversations of generations past. The aromas wafting from trattorias and gelato shops tell tales of culinary traditions that have evolved over centuries. Roman art, from classical sculptures to Baroque masterpieces, speaks of the city's passion for creativity and expression.</p><p>Rome's influence radiates across disciplines. Literature and philosophy flourished in this city of thinkers, where Cicero and Seneca once pondered life's deepest questions. The poetry of Ovid and the epic works of Virgil still resonate, a reminder that words penned millennia ago can still evoke emotions and insights today. Rome's influence extended to governance and law, shaping concepts that form the bedrock of modern society.</p><p>Beyond its tangible heritage, Rome embodies a timeless spirit. It carries the weight of triumphs and tragedies, of emperors and popes, of revolutions and rebirths. It has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the spread of Christianity, and the dawn of the Renaissance.

    "description": "<p>At the heart of studying abroad lies the opportunity to embrace new cultures and diverse viewpoints. Living in a foreign land exposes students to a tapestry of traditions, languages, and customs that challenge preconceived notions and broaden horizons. The classroom itself becomes a microcosm of the world, where peers from different backgrounds share insights that create a rich educational mosaic. This cross-cultural exchange fosters tolerance, empathy, and the ability to collaborate across cultural divides - skills that are indispensable in an increasingly interconnected world.</p><p>The academic benefits of studying abroad are equally profound. Enrolling in institutions known for their expertise in specific fields allows students to tap into resources, faculty, and research opportunities that might not be available back home. Engaging with scholars from different academic traditions stimulates intellectual curiosity, encouraging students to approach subjects from fresh angles. Additionally, exposure to innovative teaching methods and alternative educational systems equips students with adaptable learning strategies that can be applied in any academic pursuit.</p><h3>Beyond textbooks and lectures, the streets, markets, and neighborhoods of a host country become classrooms themselves. </h3><p>Language barriers transform into language learning opportunities, as students navigate daily life in a foreign tongue. Historical landmarks, museums, and local traditions offer hands-on lessons in art, history, and culture that transcend traditional classroom walls. Studying abroad is an invitation to learn not just from books but from the world itself.</p><p>Personal growth is a hallmark of the study abroad experience. Navigating the challenges of living independently in an unfamiliar environment builds resilience, self-reliance, and problem-solving skills. Away from the comfort zones of home, students discover strengths they never knew they possessed and cultivate a sense of adaptability that serves them well in both academic and personal pursuits.
